      <img class="small-icon" src="images/alert.svg">
      <h2 class="l-full">Important Note</h2>
    </span>

    <span class="l-long content">
      <p>
        Simple Posher works with items and users that it sees on the page. For example, if you are on the Poshmark homepage and there are 48 items visible, it can only share those 48 items. (If infinite share is checked, it will refresh the page after these 48 items are shared, and share the new items on the page).
      </p>
      <p>
        If the item sharer is run from inside a closet, it will scroll down to load all items in the closet before it starts sharing. However, this ONLY WORKS if the tab that you are in is the active tab in the Chrome window. Therefore, if you would like to run Simple Posher in the background while browsing the web, you must keep Poshmark open in its own window, so it is the active/open tab in that window. If you don’t, the item sharer will still work, but it will not share your full closet if it is larger than 48 active listings.
      </p>
      <p>
        This also applies to the ‘Scroll to Bottom’ button on the Auto-Follower; it can only scroll to load all followers if it is the active tab.
      </p>
    </span>

    <div class="l-long content how-to-section modules margin-bottom" id="item-sharer">

        <h2 class="l-full">Item Sharer</h2>
      </span>

      <p>
        The Item Sharer can share listings from nearly any place on Poshmark! To run,
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the page you want to share items from, e.g. your closet.</li>
        <li>If you would like to share a certain number of items, enter this number
          into the box that says ‘Number of items to share.’</li>
        <li>If you would like to randomize the order of the shared items, check the
          box next to ‘Randomize items.’ Otherwise, items will be shared in the order they appear.</li>
        <li>If you would like the item sharer to continuously run on the page, check the box next to ‘Infinite share.’</li>
        <li>Press ‘Start.’</li>
        <li>If you are in a closet, the Item Sharer will scroll to the bottom of the page to load the full closet before sharing.</li>
        <li>The Item Sharer will begin sharing items. </li>
        <li>Items shared will be logged to the console window.</li>
        <li>The item sharer will run on the page until it’s shared the number of items you’ve selected/all
          items on the page if you did not enter a number.</li>
        <li>If infinite share is checked, the sharer will refresh the page each time it is finished sharing all items on the page and continue sharing until you either press ‘Stop’ or a Captcha appears.</li>
      </ol>


      <h3>What do I do if the reCaptcha pops up?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Check the box under ‘I am not a robot’ and wait for the green checkmark to appear.</li>
        <li>Press the ‘Start’ button again.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What do I do if the Item Sharer has stopped?</h3>
      <p>This usually happens because a reCaptcha popped up and sat idle for a while. The box will disappear after sitting for a bit.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Try sharing one item manually or pressing the ‘Start’ button to see if the reCaptcha pops up.</li>
        <li>Check the box under ‘I am not a robot’ and wait for the green checkmark to appear.</li>
        <li>Press the ‘Start’ button.</li>
      </ol>

    </div>

    <div class="l-long content how-to-section modules margin-bottom" id="edit-sharer">

        <h2 class="l-full">Edit Sharer</h2>
      </span>

      <p>
        The Edit Sharer can edit-share items from your closet, skipping sold items and Meet the Posher listings. To run,
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Navigate to your closet. </li>
        <li>If you would like to share a certain number of items, enter this number
          into the box that says ‘Number of items to share.’</li>
        <li>If you would like to randomize the order of the shared items, check the
          box next to ‘Randomize items.’ Otherwise, items will be shared in the order they appear.</li>
        <li>If you would like the item sharer to continuously run on the page, check the box next to
          ‘Infinite share.’ This is *not* recommended on the Edit Sharer, because Poshmark has a low
          threshold of items that can be edit-shared before they place a temporary 24-hour freeze on this
          kind of sharing—which also affects listing new items.</li>
        <li>Press ‘Start.’</li>
        <li>The Edit Sharer will scroll to the bottom of the page to load the full closet before sharing.</li>
        <li>The Edit Sharer will begin sharing items. It will navigate to the item to be shared, click the edit, list, and confirm buttons, and then automatically navigate to the next item in the list. </li>
        <li>Items edit shared will be logged to the console window.</li>
        <li>The edit sharer will run until it has shared the number of items you’ve selected or all items on the page if you did not enter a number.</li>
        <li>If infinite share is checked, the sharer will refresh the page each time it is finished sharing all items on the page and continue sharing until you either press ‘Stop’ or a Captcha appears.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What do I do if the reCaptcha pops up?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Check the box under ‘I am not a robot’ and wait for the green checkmark to appear.</li>
        <li>Navigate back to your closet.</li>
        <li>Press the ‘Start’ button under 'Edit Share'.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What do I do if it says there’s an error and won’t share the item?</h3>
      <p>This happens when you’ve edit-shared too many items in one day, regardless
        of whether not you are using an automation software. This kind of sharing is
        more taxing on the Poshmark servers, so they place a temporary freeze on sharing
        items. You should be able to edit-share again within 24 hours. If you cannot,
        please contact Poshmark support.</p>

      <ol>

        </li>
        <li>Once all users are loaded, click ‘Start’ under 'Feed Follower.’ This module will navigate to the first user’s profile, follow them, and continue on to the next user until all users are followed.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What do I do if the reCaptcha pops up?</h3>
      <ol>

        The Auto Commenter can leave comments on user’s listings. Its intended use
        is to greet new Poshers on their ‘Meet the Posher’ listings, but you could
        also use it, for example to leave positive comments on other listings. To
        use it to greet new Posters,
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the New Poshers page by clicking the ‘Go to New Poshers Page’ button.</li>
        <li>Enter in a number for how many comments you’d like to leave. The module will leave one comment on each listing.</li>
        <li>If you would like to follow each user before leaving a comment, click the relevant checkbox. </li>
        <li>Write your comment. If you would like the user’s name (their first name, not their username) to be somewhere in the comment, write [user]. For example, if your comment read “Welcome to Poshmark, [user]!” it would show up on each page with that Posher’s name spliced in, e.g. “Welcome to Poshmark, Amy!”</li>
        <li>Press start. If you checked the ‘follow first’ checkbox, the module will navigate to the user’s profile, follow them, navigate to their Meet the Posher listing, leave a comment, and do the same to the next user. Otherwise, it will navigate directly to their Meet the Posher listing, leave a comment, and move onto the next user until all of the comments have been left.</li>

        The News Feed Activity Returner returns follows & shares from other users. For each share from a user, the module will share one item from that user’s closet, with an additional share for each like from that user. As usual, it will skip sold items and Meet the Posher listings.
      </p>
      <p>
        This module can only ‘see’ the activity that is loaded on the page, so be sure to scroll down to load all of the activity you would like to return. For example, in the mornings, I usually load all activity from the previous 8+ hours or so that I was sleeping.

      <p>
        To use this module,
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Navigate to your News Feed. </li>
        <li>Scroll down to load all of the activity you would like to return.</li>
        <li>Press ’Start’ under 'Activity Returner'.</li>
        <li>The module will navigate to the first user’s page, follow them, and return all of their shares. If they did not share any of your items, it will not share any of theirs. When it’s done, it will move onto the next user until it has returned activity for the full list of users. </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What do I do if the reCaptcha pops up?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Check the box under ‘I am not a robot’ and wait for the green checkmark to appear.</li>
        <li>Press ’Start’ under 'Activity Returner'.</li>
        <li>Refresh the page and this module will begin running again.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What do I do if 'Page Not Found' come up?</h3>
      <p>This means Poshmark couldn't find that user--it's possible they deleted their account. Press the 'Skip to Next User' Button.</p>

      <h3>What do I do if the Activity Returner has stopped?</h3>
      <p>This usually happens because a reCaptcha popped up and sat idle for a while. The box will disappear after sitting for a bit.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Try sharing a few items manually to see if the reCaptcha pops up.</li>
        <li>If so, check the box under ‘I am not a robot’ and wait for the green checkmark to appear.</li>
        <li>Press ’Start’ under 'Activity Returner'.</li>
        <li>Refresh the page.</li>
      </ol>
