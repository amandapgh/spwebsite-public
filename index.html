        <h3>Updates 05/01/19:</h3>
     </span>
     <p>Released a small patch this morning to add error codes & disable scroll pagination (adding new items on scroll) in closets when the item sharer is running, which causes multiples of items to appear.</p>

    <span>
        <h3>Updates 04/30/19:</h3>
     </span>

      <h3>Important update!</h3>
      <p>Hi guys! Just pushed the Simple Posher 2.0 update that fixes several bugs and optimizes several parts of the extension. The Item Sharers & Activity Returner have undergone almost total re-writes which will eliminate several common errors and make Simple Posher more intuitive to use! Here's what's most important to know:</p>

      <li>The extension has returned to clicking items to share (rather than sending a request in the background) because many users were having issues with Captchas not popping up. I've made sure to trigger Captchas in all relevant functions to ensure we are back to normal functionality.</li>
      <li>There is a new function called My Feed Sharer that works with the updated Poshmark feed page. The regular item sharer does NOT work on this page any longer due to the new format, however the My Feed Sharer functions in the same way and uses the same settings.</li>
      <li>Simple Posher can finally load your full closet as well as all users on /followers and /following pages without loading segments of items on different pages!</li>
      <li>The Newsfeed Activity Returner has been fixed and updated to work with the new Newsfeed page. It will work on the main tab, the shares tab, the likes tab, and the follows tab.</li>
      <li>All other functions have been optimized to reduce errors.</li>
      <br>

      <!-- <span>
        <h3>Updates 09/27/18:</h3>
      </span>
      <p>Pushed a small update today that should help with the issue of the 'free trial ended' message popping
        up for users who have changed their payment method.</p>
      <br>

      <span>
        <h3>Updates 07/25/18:</h3>
      </span>
      <p>Hi all! A few things. You may have noticed some slow-as-molassess email responses for the past few weeks.
        Unfortunately I'm dealing with some ongoing health issues which have taken me away from my Simple Posher
        work. I do apologize for any long delays you may have experienced with hearing back about bugs and other issues,
        and thanks so much for your patience and understanding.
        The good news is I've been able to hire a colleague to help with customer service work and we've been optimizing
        our internal system for tracking bug fixes, so things should be a little more efficient from here on out!</p>
      <p>For this month's Simple Posher update:</p>
      <li>I've reconfigured an important piece of how the Item Sharer works on the back end, and the main change you'll
      notice is that the console now recognizes and logs whether an item has been shared successfully or not. The way SP previously
      worked, it couldn't "see" this information--leading to things like continuing to attempt to share during a share freeze, with the
      appearance of the item sharer not working at all. This will also be helpful if trying to "share all items on page to a party,"
      as it will note which items do not fit the theme and cannot be shared.
      </li>
      <li>Fixed an issue that broke the Auto Commenter feature.</li>

      <br>

      <span>
        <h3>Updates 05/24/18:</h3>
      </span>
      <p>Lots of small but important optimizations this month!</p>
      <li>The Start and Stop buttons for each function have been merged into one button.
      This will hopefully be a little easier and more efficient for folks because you can tell
      whether a module is currently running. It will also cure all sorts of weirdness related to pressing
      start buttons more than once & injecting the script into the page multiple times.</li>
      <li>The item sharer will now continue where you left off if a captcha pops up while you're sharing!
      This should help sellers who keep their closets in a particular order.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug with the Captcha alert popping up a bunch of times.</li>
      <li>Fixed a bug regarding case sensitivity in party sharing.</li>
      <br>

      <span>
        <h3>Updates 04/23/18:</h3>
      </span>
      <p>
        The Party Sharer is finally here! Visit the <a href="#party-sharing">Party Sharing section</a> of the site
        to see how it works. As always, feel free to <a href="https://goo.gl/forms/NL24XspFMI6rR26k2">fill out our customer support form here</a> with questions and any bugs you
        may find with this new feature.
      </p>
      <p>Reverse sharing order is also an option now! You can use this if you'd like to maintain a certain order in your
        closet. To read more about this, visit the <a href="#item-sharer">Item Sharer section</a>.</p>

      <span>
        <h3>Updates 03/23/18:</h3>
      </span>
      <p>I pushed a smaller update today that will hopefully help those users whose
      extension doesn't work after trying the fixes in the general troubleshooting section.</p>
      <p>I've also connected the extension to a backup database so that I can better help users
        troubleshoot issues with the free trial/payment model. Because of this, you may get one
        more email prompt when you use the extension. As always, I do not have access to any payment information--the information I
        store in the database is 1) your email address, 2) your access level (free trial or full) and 3)
        the date you installed Simple Posher.</p>

      <p>Next on the docket:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Option to share closet in reverse order.</li>
        <li>Party sharer in progress!</li>
      </ul>

      <span>
        <h3>Updates 03/17/18:</h3>
      </span>
      <p>I pushed a new update today with some asked-for bug fixes,
        optimizations & features. Changes & additions are listed below:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The most noticeable: I added the option to control the time delay
          between follows, shares & comments. The default is set to a random
          time between 3 and 5 seconds. If you're getting a lot of reCaptchas,
          or if you've been temporarily share/follow frozen, I suggest raising these numbers and
          making sure there's a good gap between them.
        </li>
        <li>I added a solution that will *hopefully* solve the issue of the extension
          not working at all on first install/update until the page is refreshed a bunch of times.</li>
        <li>All closets now revert to AVAILABLE ITEMS ONLY since some users were
        having issues with sold items being shared. Note that this means if you would
        like to manually load your closet before sharing, you will first need to select
        available items only in the closet sidebar.</li>
        <li>I also fixed an issue where the sharer would revert back to sharing all items if a category
          or brand is selected for sharing. You can now pick categories like "Womens" or "Kids" to
          share, or individual brands.</li>
        <li>You can now infinite share on the whole site.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the reCaptcha alert wasn't popping up sometimes.</li>
        <li>Fixed an issue where the Auto Follower was looping through all followers twice</li>
      </ul>

      <span>
        <h3>Updates 01/31/18:</h3>
      </span>

      <span class="margin-bottom">
        <p>
          The extension no longer needs to scroll to load items! This means that all issues
          related to the Item Sharer and Edit Sharer not loading all closet items when running in a
          background tab are resolved, & the Auto Follower no longer needs all 1000 users to be loaded
          in order to run!
        </p>
      </span>

      <span class="margin-bottom">
        <p>
          This means the extension now operates a little differently--by loading closets/followers
          pages in segments rather than scrolling to load items. I chose to do it this way because
          unfortunately, Chrome is unable to load infinite scroll items when a tab is not the active
          tab--that is, the tab you are currently on.
        </p>
      </span>

      <span class="margin-bottom">
        <p>
          For current users, this just means that you don't have to scroll down and load an entire
          closet before regular or edit sharing--you can navigate to any closet and start running Simple
          Posher. Same goes for using the Auto Follower. Everything will work the same whether the tab is
          the open tab or not. All how-to information below has been updated if you
          would like more specifics.
        </p>
      </span>

      <span class="margin-bottom">
        <p>
          The extension still works best in the background if you disable Chrome tab throttling, which is a Chrome feature that slows down
          background tabs to save memory. I recommend disabling this while you run the extension and re-enabling afterwards.

      <p>
        The Item Sharer can share listings from nearly any place on Poshmark! To run,
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the page you want to share items from, e.g. your closet.</li>
        <li>If you would like to share a certain number of items, enter this number
          into the box that says ‘Number of items to share.’</li>
        <li>If you would like to randomize the order of the shared items, check the
          box next to ‘Randomize items.’ Otherwise, items will be shared in the order they appear.</li>
        <li>If you would like the item sharer to continuously run on the page, check the box next to ‘Infinite share.’</li>
        <li>Press ‘Start.’</li>
        <li>The page will refresh & show available items only if this option is not already selected.</li>
        <li>If inside a closet, the Item Sharer will load the full closet.</li>
        <li>Once everything is loaded, the Item Sharer will begin sharing items on the page.</li>
        <li>Sucessfully shared items will be logged to the console window. If unable to share an item, the console will note this.</li>
        <li>The item sharer will continue sharing items from your closet until it’s shared the number of items you’ve selected, or all of the
          items in your closet if you did not enter a number.</li>
        <li>If infinite share is checked, the sharer will refresh the page and start from the beginning until you press ‘Stop’ or a reCaptcha appears.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What do I do if the reCaptcha pops up?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Check the box under ‘I am not a robot’ and wait for the green checkmark to appear.</li>
        <li>Press the ‘Start’ button again.</li>
        <!-- <li>The Item Sharer will continue where it left off</li> -->
      </ol>

      <h3>What do I do if the Item Sharer has stopped?</h3>
      <p>This usually happens because a reCaptcha popped up and sat idle for a while. The box will disappear after sitting for a bit.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Try sharing one item manually or pressing the ‘Start’ button to see if the reCaptcha pops up.</li>
        <li>Check the box under ‘I am not a robot’ and wait for the green checkmark to appear.</li>
        <li>Press the ‘Start’ button.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>Help, I want to keep my closet in a certain order!</h3>
      <p>The reverse sharing option is here to help! Try the following:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Navigate to your closet and check the 'reverse share order' checkbox.</li>
        <li>Press start.</li>
        <li>After loading the closet, the Item Sharer will begin sharing your items starting from the bottom.</li>
        <li>If you get a Captcha during this process, don't refresh the page. Just restart the Item Sharer to maintain your
          closet order.</li>
      </ol>

<!--       <h3>The console says my items are being shared but they're not actually showing up as shared in Poshmark.</h3>
      <p>You probably have a temporary share freeze from Poshmark. Take a break and then try to do some manual shares. If everything is working, try setting a higher time delay to avoid this issue.</p> -->

      <!-- <h3>Items are being shared really fast, or are being shared more than once.</h3>
      <p>This can occur if you click the Start button multiple times, which runs the sharing script on the page more than
      once. Refresh the page to fix this issue.</p> -->

        <h2 class="l-full">Party Sharing</h2>
      </span>

      <p>Party sharing can be completed from anywhere the Item Sharer or works, as well as on the My Feed page. Here's how to use this feature:</p>

      <ol>
        <li>The current party (or next party, on the My Feed page) will be listed within the extension next to "Current Party." If no parties are
        happening, it will say "no parties happening now."</li>
        <li>Navigate to whatever page you want to share to the party from, e.g. your closet.</li>
        <li>The keywords tell the Party Sharer which items to to share to the current party. You can input keywords for anything you
        want to share (separated by commas). For example, for the "Lululemon, Adidas, Nike, Athleta, and Electric Yoga Party" my keywords would be:
        lululemon, adidas, nike, athleta, electric yoga. It is not case sensitive.
        For something like the "Best in Dresses & Skirts Party" my keywords could be:
        dress, gown, skirt.</li>
        <li>Use singular words (e.g. "dress" instead of "dresses"). The sharer will find any instance of this word, even if it's
          part of another word (e.g. "sundress").</li>
        <li>For a broader category party like "Best in Kids", you can choose to show the relevant items in your closet only (click the "Kids" category), and then check the "Share all Items to Page" checkbox. Both this checkbox and the "Share to Party Checkbox" must be checked to share items to party.</li>
        <li>When you've entered all of your keywords, click the "Save Keywords" button.
        <li>Click the Item Sharer start button in closets or on most of Poshmark. If on the My Feed page, click the My Feed Sharer start button. From here, everything will function like the regular Item Sharer.</li>

        <h2 class="l-full">Edit Sharer</h2>
      </span>
      <p>
        The Edit Sharer can edit-share items from your closet, skipping sold items and Meet the Posher listings. To run,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>Navigate to your closet. </li>
        <li>If you would like to share a certain number of items, enter this number
          into the box that says ‘Number of items to share.’</li>
        <li>If you would like to randomize the order of the shared items, check the
          box next to ‘Randomize items.’ Otherwise, items will be shared in the order they appear.</li>
        <li>If you would like the item sharer to continuously run on the page, check the box next to
          ‘Infinite share.’ This is *not* recommended on the Edit Sharer, because Poshmark has a low
          threshold of items that can be edit-shared before they place a temporary 24-hour freeze on this
          kind of sharing—which also affects listing new items.</li>
        <li>Press ‘Start.’</li>
        <li>The page will refresh & show available items only if this is not already selected.</li>
        <li>The Edit Sharer will load your full closet.</li>
        <li>Once loaded, it will navigate to the first item to share and proceed through the edit-sharing process.
        <li>The Edit Sharer will continue sharing items from each segment of your closet until it’s shared the number of items you’ve selected, or all of the items in your closet if you did not enter a number.</li>
        <li>If infinite share is checked, the Edit Sharer will return to your closet and continue sharing from the beginning until you either press ‘Stop’ or a Captcha appears.</li>
        </ol>

      <h3>What do I do if the reCaptcha pops up?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Check the box under ‘I am not a robot’ and wait for the green checkmark to appear.</li>
        <li>Press the ‘Start’ button under 'Edit Share'.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What do I do if it says there’s an error and won’t share the item?</h3>
      <p>This happens when you’ve edit-shared too many items in one day, regardless
        of whether not you are using an automation software. This kind of sharing is
        more taxing on the Poshmark servers, so they place a temporary freeze on sharing
        items. You should be able to edit-share again within 24 hours. If you cannot,
        please contact Poshmark support.</p>

        following page (e.g. poshmark.com/user/poshmarkuser/followers),
        including your own if you would like to follow back all of your
        followers. To use,

      <p>
        The Feed Follower can follow users from almost any page on

      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the page where you would like to follow users. </li>

        The Auto Commenter can leave comments on user’s listings. Its intended use
        is to greet new Poshers on their ‘Meet the Posher’ listings, but you could
        also use it, for example to leave positive comments on other listings. To
        use it to greet new Posters,
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the New Poshers page by clicking the ‘Go to New Poshers Page’ button.</li>
        <li>Enter in a number for how many comments you’d like to leave. The module will leave one comment on each listing.</li>
        <li>If you would like to follow each user before leaving a comment, click the relevant checkbox. </li>
        <li>Write your comment. If you would like the user’s name (their first name, not their username) to be somewhere in the comment, write [user]. For example, if your comment read “Welcome to Poshmark, [user]!” it would show up on each page with that Posher’s name spliced in, e.g. “Welcome to Poshmark, Amy!”</li>
        <li>Press start. If you checked the ‘follow first’ checkbox, the module will navigate to the user’s profile, follow them, navigate to their Meet the Posher listing, leave a comment, and do the same to the next user. Otherwise, it will navigate directly to their Meet the Posher listing, leave a comment, and move onto the next user until all of the comments have been left.</li>
      </ol>

      <p>
        The News Feed Activity Returner returns follows & shares from other users. For each share from a user, the module will share one item from that user’s closet, with an additional share for each like from that user. As usual, it will skip sold items and Meet the Posher listings.
      </p>
      <p>
        This module can only ‘see’ the activity that is loaded on the page, so be sure to scroll down to load all of the activity you would like to return. For example, in the mornings, I usually load all activity from the previous 8+ hours or so that I was sleeping.
      </p>
      <p>
        To use this module,
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Navigate to your News Feed. </li>
        <li>If you would like to share from a particular tab, e.g. the Shares tab, click on the tab.</li>
        <li>Scroll down to load all of the activity you would like to return.</li>
        <li>Press ’Start’ under 'Activity Returner'.</li>
        <li>The module will navigate to the first user’s page, follow them, and return all of their shares. If they did not share any of your items, it will not share any of theirs. When it’s done, it will move onto the next user until it has returned activity for the full list of users.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What do I do if the reCaptcha pops up?</h3>
      <ol>

        <li>Press ’Start’ under 'Activity Returner'.</li>
        <li>Refresh the page and this module will begin running again.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What do I do if 'Page Not Found' comes up?</h3>
      <p>This means Poshmark couldn't find that user--it's possible they deleted their account. Press the 'Skip to Next User' Button.</p>

      <h3>I'm on some weird page that says "followed, success: true"?</h3>
      <p>TBH I'm not sure why this happens, but if you click the back arrow the Activity Returner will continue normally.</p>

      <h3>What do I do if the Activity Returner has stopped?</h3>
      <p>This usually happens because a reCaptcha popped up and sat idle for a while. The box will disappear after sitting for a bit.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Try sharing a few items manually to see if the reCaptcha pops up.</li>
        <li>If so, check the box under ‘I am not a robot’ and wait for the green checkmark to appear.</li>
        <li>Press ’Start’ under 'Activity Returner'.</li>

      </span>

      <h3>How long is the free trial?</h3>
      <p>The free trial is 7 days. You will be alerted within the extension once the trial
      is finished.</p>

      <h3>How do I pay? Is it safe?</h3>
      <p>All payment is handled through the Chrome web store & Google Payments and is very safe. I do not have
      access to any of your payment details or identifying information.</p>

      <h3>How do I edit my payment info?</h3>
      <p>You can edit your payment information through <a href="http://payments.google.com">payments.google.com</a>

      <h3>Can I cancel my subscription if I don't like it?</h3>
      <p>You can cancel at any time through <a href="http://payments.google.com">payments.google.com</a>. When you cancel, the extension
      will be automatically removed from your browser, so I recommend waiting until right before your payment renews to get
      the best bang for your buck.</p>

      <h3>I paid, but I'm still getting the "free trial ended" message.</h3>
      <p>This is likely due to a mismatch between the email address that you logged into Simple Posher with and the email
        you used to pay. Here's how to find out:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Visit <a href="https://myaccount.google.com/permissions">myaccount.google.com/permissions</a> and check whether
          you see Simple Posher anywhere on that list. If you don't, log into any other Google accounts you may have
          and check those accounts.</li>
          <li>Look for the email receipt you received from the Chrome webstore when you paid for Simple Posher. Make sure it
          was sent to the same email address that you gave Simple Posher permission to use.</li>
          <li>If there's a mismatch, visit <a href="chrome://identity-internals">chrome://identity-internals</a> (copy and
            paste if the link doesn't work). Search
            for 'Simple Posher' on that page. You should see something like this:
            <img src="images/sp-identity-cache.png" />
          <li>Click the 'Revoke' button underneath 'Scopes'.</li>
          <li>The next time you try to use the extension, it will ask you to log in with a Google account again. Now, login
            with the same email that you used for payment.</li>
          <li>You may need to close & reopen Chrome.</li>
        </ol>

      <p>If this doesn't solve the problem, please fill out our support form at the bottom of the page.</p>

      <h3>Can I get a refund?</h3>
      <p>I offer refunds on a case-by-case basis to those who have submitted bug requests/issues I am not able to fix. If you're

      <h3>None of the modules seem to be working?</h3>
      <p>Sometimes this happens when the extension is first installed or updated. Please
      try the following:</p>
        <li>Hard refresh Poshmark several times. On Windows: hold down CTRL and click the page
          reload button, on Mac: hold Shift and click the reload button</li>
        <li>Close Chrome completely & reopen it.</li>
        <li>Disable any adblockers you may be using.</li>
        <li>Remove the extension & reinstall it (you can click the 'Try Now button if you've paid,
          just login with the same email address you paid with).</li>
        <li>Restart your computer.</li>

      <h3>Aren't Poshmark bots not allowed? Can this get me banned?</h3>
      <p>Short answer: Poshmark bots are discouraged but getting found out is highly unlikely and
        getting your account banned is even more so.</p>
      <p>Long answer:
        Poshmark does mention in their community guidelines that they discourage
        automation--this is where they also have rules about what to sell and what not to sell,
        bullying/harassment--things that sellers get away with frequently. It's unlikely that
        Poshmark would know you are using the Simple Posher extension because it's designed to mimic
        human activity as closely as possible (and in fact is designed to run more slowly than you
        can share so you can leave it running for long periods) and to stop when reCaptchas pop up. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as I'm aware, as long as the rest of your activity is within Poshmark guidelines and you
        aren't harassing other users, they don't really care what people do. More sales for you = more
        money in their pockets, since they make money every time we do.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, the use of Simple Posher is at your own risk. I use Simple Posher in my own closet so I
        am highly invested in its safety and have a lot of faith in it to work well. I'm always making
        tweaks to make it better.
