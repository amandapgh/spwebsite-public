      <span style="font-weight:bold;"class="margin-bottom">
        <p>
          The extension no longer needs to scroll to load items! This means that all issues
          related to the Item Sharer and Edit Sharer not loading all closet items when running in a
          background tab are resolved, & the Auto Follower no longer needs all 1000 users to be loaded
          in order to run!
        </p>
      </span>

      <span style="font-weight:bold;"class="margin-bottom">
        <p>
          This means the extension now operates a little differently--by loading closets/followers
          pages in segments rather than scrolling to load items. I chose to do it this way because
          unfortunately, Chrome is unable to load infinite scroll items when a tab is not the active
          tab--that is, the tab you are currently on.
        </p>
      </span>

      <span style="font-weight:bold;"class="margin-bottom">
        <p>
          For current users, this just means that you don't have to scroll down and load an entire
          closet before regular or edit sharing--you can navigate to any closet and start running Simple
          Posher. Same goes for using the Auto Follower. Everything will work the same whether the tab is
          the open tab or not. All how-to information below has been updated if you
          would like more specifics.
        </p>
      </span>

      <span style="font-weight:bold;" class="margin-bottom">
        <p>
          The extension still works best in the background if you disable Chrome tab throttling, which is a Chrome feature that slows down
          background tabs to save memory. I recommend disabling this while you run the extension and re-enabling afterwards.

      <p>
        The Item Sharer can share listings from nearly any place on Poshmark! To run,
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the page you want to share items from, e.g. your closet.</li>
        <li>If you would like to share a certain number of items, enter this number
          into the box that says ‘Number of items to share.’</li>
        <li>If you would like to randomize the order of the shared items, check the
          box next to ‘Randomize items.’ Otherwise, items will be shared in the order they appear.</li>
        <li>If you would like the item sharer to continuously run on the page, check the box next to ‘Infinite share.’</li>
        <li>Press ‘Start.’</li>
        <li>The Item Sharer will begin sharing items on the page.</li>
        <li>Items shared will be logged to the console window.</li>
        <li>If there are more than 48 active listings in the closet (and you want to share your full closet,
          or a greater number of items than 48), the item sharer will share all
          items on the first page then navigate to the next segment of 48 items then share those. You will see that
          URL changes to something like "poshmark.com/closet/username?max_id=289759283479.312" as it loads each
          segment.
        </li>
        <li>The item sharer will continue sharing items from each segment of your closet
           until it’s shared the number of items you’ve selected, or all of the
          items in your closet if you did not enter a number.</li>
        <li>If infinite share is checked, the sharer will return to the first segment of items and
          continue sharing until you either press ‘Stop’ or a Captcha appears.</li>
      </ol>


      <h3>What do I do if the reCaptcha pops up?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Check the box under ‘I am not a robot’ and wait for the green checkmark to appear.</li>
        <li>Press the ‘Start’ button again.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What do I do if the Item Sharer has stopped?</h3>
      <p>This usually happens because a reCaptcha popped up and sat idle for a while. The box will disappear after sitting for a bit.</p>

      <ol>
        <li>Try sharing one item manually or pressing the ‘Start’ button to see if the reCaptcha pops up.</li>
        <li>Check the box under ‘I am not a robot’ and wait for the green checkmark to appear.</li>
        <li>Press the ‘Start’ button.</li>
      </ol>

    </div>

    <div class="l-long content how-to-section modules margin-bottom" id="edit-sharer">

      </span>

      <p>
        The Edit Sharer can edit-share items from your closet, skipping sold items and Meet the Posher listings. To run,
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Navigate to your closet. </li>
        <li>If you would like to share a certain number of items, enter this number
          into the box that says ‘Number of items to share.’</li>
        <li>If you would like to randomize the order of the shared items, check the
          box next to ‘Randomize items.’ Otherwise, items will be shared in the order they appear.</li>
        <li>If you would like the item sharer to continuously run on the page, check the box next to
          ‘Infinite share.’ This is *not* recommended on the Edit Sharer, because Poshmark has a low
          threshold of items that can be edit-shared before they place a temporary 24-hour freeze on this
          kind of sharing—which also affects listing new items.</li>
        <li>Press ‘Start.’</li>
        <li>If there are more than 48 active listings in the closet (and you want to edit share your full closet,
          or a greater number of items than 48), the Edit Sharer will share all
          items on the first page then navigate to the next segment of 48 items then share those. You will see that
          URL changes to something like "poshmark.com/closet/username?max_id=289759283479.312" as it loads
          each segment.
        </li>
        <li>The Edit Sharer will continue sharing items from each segment of your closet
           until it’s shared the number of items you’ve selected, or all of the
          items in your closet if you did not enter a number.</li>
        <li>If infinite share is checked, the Edit Sharer will return to the first segment of items and
          continue sharing until you either press ‘Stop’ or a Captcha appears.</li>
        </ol>

      <h3>What do I do if the reCaptcha pops up?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Check the box under ‘I am not a robot’ and wait for the green checkmark to appear.</li>
        <li>Navigate back to your closet.</li>
        <li>Press the ‘Start’ button under 'Edit Share'.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What do I do if it says there’s an error and won’t share the item?</h3>
      <p>This happens when you’ve edit-shared too many items in one day, regardless
        of whether not you are using an automation software. This kind of sharing is
        more taxing on the Poshmark servers, so they place a temporary freeze on sharing
        items. You should be able to edit-share again within 24 hours. If you cannot,
        please contact Poshmark support.</p>

        <h2 class="l-full">Feed Follower</h2>
      </span>

      <p>
        The Feed Follower can follow users from almost any page on
        Poshmark-—essentially anywhere the Auto Follower doesn’t cover. To use,
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the page where you would like to follow users. </li>
        <li>Scroll down to load all of the users you would like to follow. There are 48 users on a typical Poshmark page (assuming each item on the page is from a different user).
        </li>
        <li>Once all users are loaded, click ‘Start’ under 'Feed Follower.’ This module will navigate to the first user’s profile, follow them, and continue on to the next user until all users are followed.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What do I do if the reCaptcha pops up?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Check the box under ‘I am not a robot’ and wait for the green checkmark to appear.</li>
        <li>Navigate back to the page where you’d like to follow users.</li>
        <li>Press 'Start' under 'Feed Follower'.</li>
      </ol>

    </div>

    <div class="l-long content how-to-section modules margin-bottom" id="auto-commenter">

      <span class="flex vert-center l-full bottom-padding">
        <img class="small-icon" src="images/comment.svg">
        <h2 class="l-full">Auto Commenter</h2>
      </span>

      <p>
        The Auto Commenter can leave comments on user’s listings. Its intended use
        is to greet new Poshers on their ‘Meet the Posher’ listings, but you could
        also use it, for example to leave positive comments on other listings. To
        use it to greet new Posters,
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Navigate to the New Poshers page by clicking the ‘Go to New Poshers Page’ button.</li>
        <li>Enter in a number for how many comments you’d like to leave. The module will leave one comment on each listing.</li>
        <li>If you would like to follow each user before leaving a comment, click the relevant checkbox. </li>
        <li>Write your comment. If you would like the user’s name (their first name, not their username) to be somewhere in the comment, write [user]. For example, if your comment read “Welcome to Poshmark, [user]!” it would show up on each page with that Posher’s name spliced in, e.g. “Welcome to Poshmark, Amy!”</li>
        <li>Press start. If you checked the ‘follow first’ checkbox, the module will navigate to the user’s profile, follow them, navigate to their Meet the Posher listing, leave a comment, and do the same to the next user. Otherwise, it will navigate directly to their Meet the Posher listing, leave a comment, and move onto the next user until all of the comments have been left.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What do I do if the reCaptcha pops up?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Check the box under ‘I am not a robot’ and wait for the green checkmark to appear.</li>
        <li>Navigate back to the New Poshers Page.</li>
        <li>Press ‘Start’ under ‘Auto Commenter’.</li>
      </ol>

    <div class="l-long content how-to-section modules margin-bottom" id="activity-returner">
      <span class="flex vert-center l-full bottom-padding">
        <img class="small-icon" src="images/heart.svg">
        <h2 class="l-full">News Feed Activity Returner</h2>
      </span>

      <p>
        The News Feed Activity Returner returns follows & shares from other users. For each share from a user, the module will share one item from that user’s closet, with an additional share for each like from that user. As usual, it will skip sold items and Meet the Posher listings.
      </p>
      <p>
        This module can only ‘see’ the activity that is loaded on the page, so be sure to scroll down to load all of the activity you would like to return. For example, in the mornings, I usually load all activity from the previous 8+ hours or so that I was sleeping.
      </p>
      <p>
        To use this module,
      </p>

      <ol>
        <li>Navigate to your News Feed. </li>
        <li>Scroll down to load all of the activity you would like to return.</li>
        <li>Press ’Start’ under 'Activity Returner'.</li>
        <li>The module will navigate to the first user’s page, follow them, and return all of their shares. If they did not share any of your items, it will not share any of theirs. When it’s done, it will move onto the next user until it has returned activity for the full list of users. </li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What do I do if the reCaptcha pops up?</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Check the box under ‘I am not a robot’ and wait for the green checkmark to appear.</li>
        <li>Press ’Start’ under 'Activity Returner'.</li>
        <li>Refresh the page and this module will begin running again.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>What do I do if 'Page Not Found' comes up?</h3>
      <p>This means Poshmark couldn't find that user--it's possible they deleted their account. Press the 'Skip to Next User' Button.</p>

      <h3>I'm on some weird page that says "followed, success: true"?</h3>
      <p>TBH I'm not sure why this happens, but if you click the back arrow the Activity Returner will continue normally.</p>

      <h3>What do I do if the Activity Returner has stopped?</h3>
      <p>This usually happens because a reCaptcha popped up and sat idle for a while. The box will disappear after sitting for a bit.</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Try sharing a few items manually to see if the reCaptcha pops up.</li>
        <li>If so, check the box under ‘I am not a robot’ and wait for the green checkmark to appear.</li>
        <li>Press ’Start’ under 'Activity Returner'.</li>
        <li>Refresh the page.</li>
      </ol>

      <h3>How long is the free trial?</h3>
      <p>The free trial is 7 days. You will be alerted within the extension once the trial
      is finished.</p>

      <h3>How do I pay? Is it safe?</h3>
      <p>All payment is handled through the Chrome web store and is very safe. I do not have
      access to any of your payment details or identifying information.</p>

      <h3>Can I cancel my subscription if I don't like it?</h3>
      <p>You can cancel at any time through the Chrome web store. When you cancel, the extension
      will be automatically removed from your browser.</p>

      <h3>None of the modules seem to be working?</h3>
      <p>Sometimes this happens when the extension is first installed or updated. Refreshing the page
        usually solves this issue. If that doesn't help, please contact simpleposher@gmail.com</p>

      <h3>Aren't Poshmark bots not allowed? Can this get me banned?</h3>
      <p>Short answer: Poshmark bots are discouraged but getting found out is highly unlikely and
        getting your account banned is even more so.</p>
      <p>Long answer:
        Poshmark does mention in their community guidelines that they discourage
        automation--this is where they also have rules about what to sell and what not to sell,
        bullying/harassment--things that sellers get away with frequently. It's unlikely that
        Poshmark would know you are using the Simple Posher extension because it's designed to mimic
        human activity as closely as possible (and in fact is designed to run more slowly than you
        can share so you can leave it running for long periods) and to stop when reCaptchas pop up. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as I'm aware, as long as the rest of your activity is within Poshmark guidelines and you
        aren't harassing other users, they don't really care what people do. More sales for you = more
        money in their pockets, since they make money every time we do.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, the use of Simple Posher is at your own risk. I use Simple Posher in my own closet so I
        am highly invested in its safety and have a lot of faith in it to work well. I'm always making
        tweaks to make it better.
